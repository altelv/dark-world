Dark World â€” Patch to align SVG Combat Overlay with Passport v3

Changes:
1) Activated SVG overlay as the single source of truth; disabled legacy HTML overlay triggers.
   - index.html: removed onclick to window.__openCombat() (now marked legacy); auto-open call disabled.
   - Commented legacy includes: blocks/combat/combat.css and blocks/combat/combat.js.

2) Movement highlights updated (hlMoves):
   - forward 1, forward 2, left 1, right 1, and all four diagonals (1 cell each),
   - orientation follows camera rotation.

3) Buttons fixed:
   - Renamed btn_ATTAK -> btn_attack in SVG,
   - Removed duplicate btn_potion1,
   - Added handlers for: attack, defense, ranger_precise, throw, potion, bandage, rollback, end_turn, turn_left/right.

4) Camera rotation made robust:
   - Rotation axis computed from #board.getBBox() center (no magic numbers).

5) Event bridge:
   - UI dispatches CustomEvent('dw:combat:action', {kind}) on action clicks.
   - End turn additionally dispatches CustomEvent('dw:combat:endTurn').

Files to replace (keep relative paths):
- /combat-overlay.svg
- /js/combat-overlay.js
- /index.html
